#### OPTIMIZATION VS METAHEURISTICS: A TRAVELING PURCHASER PROBLEM (TPP) CASE OF STUDY 

One of the most researched extensions of the Traveling Salesperson Problem is the Traveling Purchaser Problem (TPP). The goal of TPP is to discover a tour that reduces the cost of purchasing all of the items as well as the expense of visiting the various marketplaces. Researchers are using heuristics also to reduce the computational complexity of the travelling purchaser problem. In this project, I'll look into a transportation network and assess the optimal network using the Traveling Purchaser Problem. The model can solve using either traditional optimization methods or metaheuristics. In this work, I implemented more metaheuristics and tradition optimization to check the difference between their performance in sense of optimal route and computation complexity. As a metaheuristics technique, genetic algorithm was used in this study and optimization was performing better in sense of results and computation complexity as well.
